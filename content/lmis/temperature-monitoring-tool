# Temperature monitoring tool

This Default Data Entry Form ("aggregate") allows storekeepers at health care facilities to enter monthly data on demand ("consumption") as well as stock on hand digitally on a on- or off-line on a mobile device and synchronize the data with a central DHIS2 server for analysis, data sharing and integration with national eLMIS systems.

## Use case

### Monthly stock report - Data recording

At the end of the month, storekeepers will count the quantity of all health care products in the medical store and record the stock on hand. Furthermore, to obtain the total amount of each health care product issued from the medical store from the first to the last day of the month and record the total monthly demand ("consumption") directly on a mobile device. The list of stock items ("Data Elements") can be adapted to each health care facility as needed and user access can be given selectively to individual storekeepers as required.

### Monthly stock report - Data recording and calculation

In addition to the above: at the end of the month after the physical stock count and all data has been entered, Predictors automatically calculate the following data:
- Opening balance: identical with the "Stock on hand" from the end of the previous month
- Closing balance: Opening balance + Stock received - Stock distributed - Stock redistributed - Stock discarded   
- Stock discrepancy: Stock on hand (as counted) - Closing balance
- Stock on hand Yes/No: calculates whether a stockout occurred at the end of the month (at the time of the physical stock count)  

## Maintenance Web App - DHIS2 metadata configuration

The configuration of this Default Data Entry form uses "Disaggregation categories" as this is technically the only way to display a table for recording data in the DHIS2 Android Capture App on a mobile device and relies only on basic, native DHIS2 functionality.

### 2 DATA ELEMENT

### 2.1 Data element
Data elements represent the items (healthcare products) for which logistics data is recorded and managed. A separate and unique Data element needs to be configured for each item (healthcare product).

### 2.2 Data element group

The creation of Data element groups is a DHIS2 best practice but also a precondition for using the "Group Predictor" functionality which allows using a placeholder and the Data element group ID for creating a single Predictor which is automatically applied to all Data elements in the respective Data element group. For example for calculating the stock coverage time.

>**1 Stock item list - MSR**  
>**Name \(*)**: "Stock item list - MSR"  
>**Short name \(*)**: "Stock item list - MSR"
>**Data elements \(*)**: *select all Data elements with the "MSR" suffix"*    

### 3 Data set

This Default Data Entry Form ("aggregate") allows storekeepers at health care facilities to enter monthly data on demand ("consumption") as well as stock on hand digitally on a on- or off-line on a mobile device and synchronize the data with a central DHIS2 server for analysis, data sharing and integration with national eLMIS systems.

#### 3.1 Data set
Data sets for each Organisation unit are required for recording and storing monthly stock report data.
The sections can be displayed in the Data Entry (beta) Web App as well as in the Capture Android App either in a single table or as separate tabs.
The configuration for two Data sets are presented below, but either the one or the other should be used:
- "MSR - Monthly stock report - Data recording"
- "MSR - Monthly stock report - Data recording and calculation"

In addition to the configuration presented above, this Default Data Entry Form automatically calculates the "Opening balance" (stock on hand from the end of the previous month), "Closing balance" (Opening balance plus all stock receipts minus all stock issues) as well as "Stock discrepancy" (difference between the Stock on hand as counted and the calculated Closing balance).

3 MANUAL TEMPERATURE RECORDING / "aggregate" data entry form
This simple Default Data Entry allows digitizing the the twice daily manual temperature recordings on paper forms, sharing and analysing them digitally on the DHIS2 database
3.1 Use case
Twice a day, in the morning when starting work and in the afternoon before leaving, the storekeeper reads out the room temperature from the storeroom as well as each refrigerator and freezer used for storing vaccines and other drug products and records the minimum, current as well as maximum temperature on a mobile device. The storekeeper at the health care facility as well as cold chain technicians or biomedical engineers anywhere else can access the record and review the data table as well as the chart for assessing the cold chain.
3.2 DHIS2 configuration
The configuration of this Default Data Entry form uses "Disaggregation categories" as this is technically the only way to display a table for recording data in the DHIS2 Capture app on a mobile device. Every refrigerator, freezer or other place (such as a store room) where temperature needs to be recorded is configured as a separate "Data element". The application uses only simple and native DHIS2 functionality.
