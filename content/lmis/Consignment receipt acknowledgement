# Consignment receipt acknowledgement / Tracker program

## Introduction

This very simple Event program allows users at healthcare facilities to acknowledge receipt of consignments on a mobile device by scanning any type of barcode printed on the packing list. The configuration includes the option of signing on the screen of the mobile device, recording the geolocation of receipt and taking an image but additional features can be added as needed.

## Use case

The medical store which supplies the respective healthcare facility processes the order, picks, packs and ships the consignment with a packing list with a barcode indicating the consignment identification printed on it. The storekeeper receives, unloads, checks the consignment and acknowledges receipt by scanning the barcode and completing the Event Program form with additional information such as the geolocation of the mobile device used, signing on the screen and taking an image of the consignment, for example in front of the healthcare facility or in the pharmacy. After synchronising the Capture Android app, all these details are synchronised with the central DHIS2 instance and available to any DHIS2 user in the country.
The information can be used simply to allow supply managers to keep track for which consignments delivery was confirmed and for which they are still pending.
When using the DHIS2-RTS (Real-Time Stock management system), the acknowledgement of receipt
