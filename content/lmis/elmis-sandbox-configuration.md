### 1 INTRODUCTION

This document is intended to demonstrate some fully functional prototype for using DHIS2 logistics applications at the health care facility level.

#### 1.1 Audience

This guide is intended for users interested in using DHIS2 for logistics applications at the health care facility level as well as for implementers supporting any implementations.

#### 1.2 Purpose

This short guide intends to demonstrate the feasibility of and options for configuring DHIS2 as end-user logistics applications while promoting best practices for logistics management.

This guide explains (only) the settings specific to the use case such as the Category options or Data Set settings but not the details of Organisation Units, User roles etc. which are not specific to the configuration.

The metadata configurations are presented in the order in which they appear in the DHIS2 "Maintenance" app.

Users are encouraged to adopt these prototypes to their specific use cases, situations, constraints and needs.

#### 1.3 Design principles

The applications are all "designed for Android" (mobile applications) for use on mobile devices (mobile phones or tablet computers). This also means that all applications can be used off-line for any period of time and data can be synchronized once a suitable network connection is available (again).

All applications are kept as simple as possible and only configured with essential features in order to minimize the workload of (health) staff at health care facilities as well as the amount of data as much as possible.

As much as possible wherever possible native DHIS2 functionality is used.

#### 1.4 System access and updates

The sandbox can be accessed through the following URL:

https://lmis.integration.dhis2.org/sandbox

The credentials (user name and password) are provided on the login page.

For accessing the applications on the mobile device, the DHIS2 Capture app needs to be downloaded from Google Plastore and be installed on the mobile device. Access is available with the same credentials as for the web portal.

Users are welcome to explore the system by entering data and modifying the configuration. However, all data will be erased and all changes will be reset to the original version very day during the night hours.

#### 1.5 Feedback

Please provide any feedback, suggestions for improvements or other use cases on the DHIS2 communityLMIS channel:
