# Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

When discussing SOPs, we must differentiate them from other resources such as learning and instructional material. SOPs outline specific procedures and activities to complete a task based on internally defined best practices. They can reference additional resources that describe step-by-step tasks to carry out a specific component within the SOP, but the SOP itself should not only contain this information. SOPs should instead describe what the procedure is for, any specific steps required to implement and monitor the procedure along with the specific roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders involved in the procedure being outlined.

We can do a quick comparison of describing an SOP vs training material with ***users*** as our example in order to highlight this difference, as these terms should not be used interchangeably.

| Training Material 	| SOPs 	|
|---	|---	|
| Describes the step-by-step process of creating a user in DHIS2: <ul> <li>What app to access</li> <li>Where to click within DHIS2 to create a new user</li><li>What each of the fields in the users app means</li><li>How to add user roles to a user</li><li>How to assign organisation units to a user</li><li>How to assign a user to user groups</li><li>What each of the fields in the users app means</li><li>Mandatory fields to fill in</li><li>Etc.</li></ul>  	| Describe the process to manage and administer users as well as deal with requests for new users <ul><li>How are new users requested</li><li>Who is allowed to create a new user</li><li>What are the users roles and groups in the system</li><li>How are these roles and groups used to build a new user based on their function in the system</li><li>How is organisation unit access determined</li><li>How is metadata and data access determined</li><li>How are account details created (naming conventions, passwords, etc.) and shared</li></ul>	||

## Creating and Implementing and SOP

> **Important**
>
> SOPs are considered ***complementary*** to training material in that they describes the **mechanics** of how to perform a specific task. 
> 
> They need to work together with training material in order to be implemented effectively.

 To effectively create and implement an SOP, several steps are recommended.

1. Review of the topic
2. Training on how to perform related tasks
3. Drafting and testing the SOPs
4. Training on the SOPs
5. Monitoring their implementation
